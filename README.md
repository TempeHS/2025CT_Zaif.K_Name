<img width="987" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49043d69-71cf-4ad2-b4b3-f739804366e2" />
<p>The main menu of <b>ECO RUNNER  </b> sets the tone for an immersive, environmentally conscious gaming experience. With its striking visual design and clear thematic messaging, it invites players into a world where sustainability and action go hand in hand.</p>
The menu offers three straightforward options in vibrant green text:

<b> PLAY</b> ‚Äì Launches the game, signaling immediate engagement with eco-themed challenges.

<b>OPTIONS</b> ‚Äì Allows players to customize settings, likely including controls, audio, and possibly eco-related gameplay modifiers. Although this hasn't been coded yet. 

<b> QUIT</b> ‚Äì Exits the game, maintaining the minimalist and user-friendly interface. Whilst this has been coded this is only possible outside of Unity when the game has been fully developed. , <i>All these button uses SpatialMappingOcclusion</i> to achieve this desired effect.

## Why it Matters 
Eco Runner helps players understand that:

* Climate change is a shared responsibility

* Small actions can lead to meaningful impact

* Games can be a force for good

## Features

ü™ô Coin Collection System
The coin mechanic serves as both a reward and a progression driver. Coins are strategically placed to encourage exploration and risk-taking, often positioned near hazards or on elevated platforms. Each coin collected contributes to the player's score and may unlock future upgrades or achievements. The floating animation and subtle glow effect make them visually enticing, while their placement subtly guides the player through optimal paths.

‚è±Ô∏è Time Limit & Self-Destruct Mechanism
Each level is coded with a 90-second time window, adding urgency and pacing to the gameplay. If the player fails to reach the goal within this limit, a self-destruction sequence is triggered‚Äîwhether through environmental collapse, character fade-out, or a thematic "nature rejection" effect. This mechanic reinforces the idea that action must be timely to preserve the ecosystem, aligning with the game‚Äôs environmental message.

‚è∏Ô∏è Resume/Pause Menu
The pause menu is clean and functional, allowing players to pause gameplay in real time with adherence to the physics of the game.

üß± Spike Dodging & Level Progression
Progression to Level 2 requires precise movement and hazard avoidance. Spikes are placed as environmental threats that demand timing and spatial awareness. Their placement isn‚Äôt random‚Äîthey‚Äôre designed to test the player‚Äôs mastery of jump arcs and platform spacing. Successfully dodging them not only unlocks the next level but reinforces the theme of navigating a damaged world with care and precision.

‚ö†Ô∏è Death Boundary
A coded death boundary ensures that falling off-screen or into designated danger zones results in instant failure. This mechanic maintains challenge integrity and prevents unintended exploration beyond the designed map. It‚Äôs a classic platformer feature, but here it‚Äôs framed as falling into ecological ruin‚Äîadding thematic weight to player failure.

üé• Virtual Camera Follow
* The game uses a virtual camera system that smoothly tracks the player‚Äôs movement across the tilemap. This dynamic follow ensures:

* Consistent framing of the character

* Visibility of upcoming terrain and hazards

A cinematic feel that enhances immersion The camera may also zoom or pan slightly during key moments (e.g., coin pickups, near-death escapes), adding polish and emotional impact.
## Spawn Entry:
 <img width="990" height="554" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbd19204-4064-48d0-b3da-5c56f84eeadc" />
<p>In designing the spawn environment for Eco Runner, I aimed to create a visually immersive and thematically rich entry point that immediately communicates the game‚Äôs ecological focus. The tilemap features layered grassy platforms with soft, organic edges, suggesting natural terrain rather than rigid, artificial structures. I used pixel textures that blend earthy tones‚Äîdeep greens, muted browns, and mossy overlays‚Äîto evoke a sense of overgrowth and renewal. The background, with its silhouetted pine trees and twilight sky, adds depth and atmosphere, reinforcing the idea that the player is entering a forest in recovery. Every texture was chosen to feel hand-crafted and alive, from the flower crown on the character to the subtle shimmer of the coin, creating a world where nature is central and every detail supports the theme of restoration. My goal was to make the player feel grounded in a living ecosystem from the very first moment, where exploration and environmental impact are tightly intertwined.</p>


## Character Design & Storyline:
üåç The Year is 2145. Earth is in Crisis.

The ice caps have melted. Sea levels have swallowed coastlines. Forests are fading into memory, and the air is thick with pollution. Humanity stands at a crossroads.

But one hero refuses to give up.

Meet Kai, a fearless climate defender armed with cutting-edge eco-tech and unstoppable courage. From the flooded ruins of old cities to the last surviving green zones, Kai battles the forces destroying our planet.

I‚Äôve effectively incorporated free or credited assets (e.g. pixel art tiles, character sprites, UI icons) to build a cohesive visual style. These assets are integrated seamlessly into your game world, and their use is clearly acknowledged in your documentation. With the experimentation of various sprites and assets, I have continued to develop my game with a range of interactive features. Most of the files are organised and have been up to date whilst being commited to GitHub in regular intervals. 

## Developer Docuementation

## Tilemaps
Whilst this was effective in my game currently I have faced alot of issues that I have resolved with Tilemap slicing, editing and modification.
<img width="448" height="298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db3dad10-3e09-4d3c-80c0-c87b7cfc6d7e" /> <img width="448" height="298" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d6d3c1e-0ec4-47f4-80ac-3f82a99a433b" />

<p> Various tile palletes were used for this mostly from the Unity Asset store. The tilemaps in Eco Runner were crafted using a diverse mix of tile palettes, primarily sourced from the Unity Asset Store and supplemented by custom assets provided by my multimedia partner. This hybrid approach allowed for both consistency and creative flexibility‚Äîstandardized tiles ensured smooth integration with Unity‚Äôs grid system, while bespoke textures added thematic depth and uniqueness to the game world. Grass platforms, mossy edges, and layered terrain were carefully selected to evoke a sense of natural regrowth, aligning with the game‚Äôs environmental message. Each tile was placed with intention, balancing visual appeal with gameplay clarity, and creating a world that feels both handcrafted and alive. This collaborative asset strategy not only streamlined development but also showcased my ability to integrate external resources into a cohesive, playable environment. The effect was used to mimick the mood and storyline of the game which is directly linked to the background and environment which the player navigates. </p>

The PlayerMovement script is a core component of Eco Runner, responsible for handling dynamic character control in a 2D platformer environment. Written in C# for Unity, it integrates physics-based movement, animation control, and dash mechanics to create a responsive and engaging player experience.

üîß Key Functionalities
Horizontal Movement & Jumping:

* Controlled via horizontal, speed, and jumpingPower variables.

* Uses Rigidbody2D to apply force-based movement, ensuring smooth physics interactions.

* Ground detection is handled via groundCheck and groundLayer, allowing for accurate jump conditions.

Dash Mechanic:

* Includes variables for dashingPower, dashingTime, and dashingCooldown.

* Boolean flags (canDash, isDashing) manage dash availability and state.

* TrailRenderer adds visual feedback during dashing, enhancing player immersion.

Facing Direction:

* isFacingRight tracks player orientation, enabling sprite flipping for left/right movement.

* This ensures animations and movement remain visually consistent.

Animation Integration:

* The Animator component is initialized and used to trigger movement and dash animations based on player input and state.

  ##  Level 2:
Level 2 of Eco Runner remains partially developed due to time constraints and asset limitations. While a basic boss entity was successfully implemented using foundational physics mechanics (e.g., collision detection, movement patterns), the broader level environment could not be fully realized. Initial sprite contributions from my multimedia partner‚Äîparticularly for dirt tiles and floating islands‚Äîlacked the visual depth and polish required to maintain consistency with the game‚Äôs aesthetic. These assets appeared flat and under-detailed, which impacted immersion and gameplay clarity. To address this, I sourced higher-quality tilemaps and environmental textures from the Unity Asset Store, ensuring a more cohesive and professional look. This decision reflects my commitment to visual fidelity and player experience, even when working within collaborative or time-bound constraints
  <img width="993" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce1bfe8d-d565-4615-87a8-c9a594595df8" />
Boss:
Level 2 was meant to be a turning point in the game ‚Äî a shift in tone, difficulty, and narrative tension. The environment was more dynamic, with layered backgrounds and tighter platforming challenges. I had planned for the level to culminate in a final boss encounter that would test everything the player had learned so far.

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt implement the final boss sprite in time. The concept was there ‚Äî I had the design sketched out and the mechanics partially mapped ‚Äî but the sprite itself never made it into the build. There were a few reasons: some technical hiccups with the animation controller, a mismatch between the sprite dimensions and the hitbox setup, and honestly, a crunch on time that forced me to prioritize core gameplay over polish.

As a result, the level ends without the boss fight I‚Äôd envisioned. It‚Äôs a bit abrupt, and I know it leaves a gap in the pacing. But I still see Level 2 as a strong foundation ‚Äî the buildup is there, and the placeholder ending gives me room to expand in future updates. The boss sprite is still on my list, and once it‚Äôs properly rigged and animated, I‚Äôll be able to deliver the climax this level deserves.

## Outstanding Elements
Multimedia Partner did deliver with the a few sprites e.g Protagonist. However some of them lacked detail anddid not satisfy what I wanted to build and achieve. That's why I went to Unity Asset store and utilised their free online assets, resources and tile maps.
